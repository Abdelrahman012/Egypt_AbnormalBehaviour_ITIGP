# Egypt_AbnormalBehaviour_ITIGP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is used to to determine the abnormal crowed behavior in Egypt street by taking 
the video and do some processing to prepare it to fit into the Model.

#### Accuracy on Training Data is : 99.1% 
#### Accuracy on Test Data is : 97.5 %
#### Data : was manually Detected and Labeled from camera videos in Egypt streeet 

The Model was an implementaion from research paper, you can find it in that [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-020-00207-x)
